# Analyzing-the-Analysts
Analyzing the Price Targets set by brokerages against actual stock performance. An exploratory analysis to pull ratings data, historical stock performance and generate a time series graph to visualize how well the banks are at predicitng stock prices.

Written in Python 3, I've only tested it for U.S. exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ) the following are the requirements from the user:
  1) You'll need a few packages to get this to run properly
    a) beautifulsoup4
    b) Pandas and Numpy
    c) matplotlib and seaborn
    d) re (regex) 
  2) Set your working directory for where you want the graph to be saved
  3) In the second cell, input the company you want to see - by it's ticker e.g. "MSFT", "GE", "NIO"
  4) Input which exchange it is traded on. e.g for MSFT, it's traded on the "NASDAQ", GE is traded on the "NYSE"
  5) Run my script, the graph will be saved where you set your working directory.
